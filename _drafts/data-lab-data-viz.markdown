Intro: the competition, the co-benefits atlas, Luigi, the initial idea

The Data Lab have recently closed submissions for their latest [Data Visualisation Competition](https://thedatalab.com/data-visualisation-competition-2025/). This year's competition centred on data behind the [UK Co-benefits Atlas](https://ukcobenefitsatlas.net/). The challenge was "to uncover and visualise a story from the data that has the potential to shift perspectives and influence beliefs".

What are co-benefits? 

Co-benefits are essentially side-effects of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, reducing fuel use by reducing car travel might "accidentally" increase physical activity (from, say, cycling to work). Or a move towards more plant-based diets for environmental reasons may also result in a positive impact on health. On the other hand, some co-benefits are not benefits at all. For example, more active travel and public transport might result in longer commute times. The UK Cobenefits Atlas is based on modelling from the University of Edinburgh, based on climate action recommended by the [Climate Change Committee](https://www.theccc.org.uk/) in its Seventh Carbon Budget. Co-benefits are converted into a monetary value across 45,000 geographical areas covering the whole of the UK. This value is split between 11 different co-benefits (including physical activity increase, dietary improvements, road repairs impact...). The website already has some pretty comprehensive interactive visualisations where users can play around with different areas and combinations of co-benefits.

Luigi Creazzo (link) and I collaborated on a joint entry. Our initial broad idea was to see if we could connect co-benefits related to travel and green space with local government active travel plans and similar initiatives. In particular, we aimed to focus on Fife and Edinburgh as areas we are both familiar with.

As it happens, we have both moved house recently, and in the course of house-hunting have used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (link). What is this data? Since both this and the co-benefits data is available at the level of quite small areas, we decided to incorporate the SIMD data to gain insight into how co-benefits are distributed across socio-economic brackets. Perhaps climate-change mitigation actions could help level the playing field. Or will they magnify existing inequalities?
