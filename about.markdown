My name is Alex. I am a mathematician by training, currently learning new data analysis skills. This is a blog to document my learning progress, and perhaps other things that I want to write about.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-evetts-a9a93a1aa/) or see my mathematics research on my [academic webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/aevetts/home).
